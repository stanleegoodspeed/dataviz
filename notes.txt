Notes
- For the beeswarm to work, I need alot of bees ( ~600 )
- Each bee has to be a unique data point in the CSV ( individual row )
- The bees have to have a common identifier that groups them together ( mortgage rate )

Possible charts to use
- scatterplot
- unit chart


TODO
- how do I group different dots by color (e.g. all dots with Rate=1 should be red)
- how do I add a transition?
